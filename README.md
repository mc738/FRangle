# FRangle

`FRangle` is a library for creating pipelines.
It comes with a set of operations for common tasks like calling HTTP endpoints, IO and ETL functions.
The aim is to make it easy to chain these operations (and user defined ones) together.
This following the `unix` philosophy and is heavily influenced by `railway orientated programming`.

The library also contains a collection of `infixes` to cut down on boilplate code.
